[Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/) is a crowdsourced security platform. It was founded in 2011 and in 2019 it was one of the largest bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure companies on the internet. Researchers participating in their program will receive a reward for valid bugs and be prioritized to invite other private programs.

Today, we are proud to announce that our researcher, Mr. Nguyen Van Tien Thanh (nhien_and_a_broken_leaderboard, thanhnhien, yeuchimse) is in the top 10 ranking researchers of Bugcrowd. This is an excellent result for Thanh's efforts and contributions to the cyber security community. Congratulations Thanh!
