Pwn2Own is a computer hacking contest held annually by [Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative - ZDI](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/). Contestants are challenged to exploit widely used software and mobile devices with previously unknown vulnerabilities. Winners of the contest receive the device that they exploited and a cash prize. The total prize for each contest is up to millions of dollars.
